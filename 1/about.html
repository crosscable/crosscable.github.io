(zyBooks.com)</p></div><div class="content-resource html-resource html-content-resource ember-view"><h3>Summary</h3></div><div class="content-resource html-resource html-content-resource ember-view"><p>A visually-animated interactive intro to the increasingly important topic of discrete mathematics for computer science, math, and others, serving as a complete textbook replacement and more.</p></div><div class="content-resource html-resource html-content-resource ember-view"><h3>Description</h3></div><div class="content-resource html-resource html-content-resource ember-view"><p>  As the role of computer science in modern careers continues to grow, the importance of discrete mathematics increases as well. Discrete math is the study of finite and countable sets. Topics include logical reasoning (if x then y), algorithms about integers (and applications to cryptography), and counting (the basis of discrete probability). In contrast to the more-familiar mathematics of continuous numbers like calculus, discrete mathematics forms the foundation of much of computer science. As such, the need to learn discrete mathematics expands to more programs not only at the college level, but at the high-school level as well. </p><p> Unlike existing discrete mathematics books that students increasingly don't read (even in e-form or with supplementary online activities), this material was written from-scratch for the web. Discrete mathematics is a highly-visual discipline, so this zyBook contains hundreds of animations (more than any other zyBook to date), helping clarify challenging topics, and bringing the material to life. The zyBook contains hundreds of embedded interactive questions to enhance learning. Tools for particularly challenging topics exist, such as set operations.</p><p>The zyBook also contains built-in, auto-generated/auto-graded challenge exercises. The challenge exercises include homework-appropriate challenges like converting English to compound propositions, simplifying compound propositions, performing set operations, drawing arrow diagrams, counting permutations and subsets, etc., all auto-graded. Students get extensive practice with immediate feedback and thus better learning, while instructors save huge amounts of grading time.</p><p> The material is configurable by instructors too.  See <a href="https://www.zybooks.com" target="_blank">zybooks.com</a> for more on the zyBook "less-text more-action" approach.</p><p> Using Rosen? <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT-k_G86K2mnizi4dB_6FFYnkZU_SfCyLSHaOF7oj_gSmbIiLLehUGPK9DZCqVgOnG8RDTjlpyZWZyp/pub" target="_blank"> Switching is easy</a>.</p><p>This discrete mathematics zyBook covers the foundational topics in discrete mathematics required for more advanced study in computer science. Students learn to translate English descriptions of everyday scenarios into precise mathematical statements that can then be used for formal analysis. Applications are described so that students get a feel for how the mathematical tools they are learning will be applied later in their studies. The material is formed from years of experience teaching discrete math to undergraduates and contains many explanations to common questions and misconceptions that students have about this material.</p></div><div class="content-resource html-resource html-content-resource ember-view"><h3>End-of-section exercises</h3></div><div class="content-resource html-resource html-content-resource ember-view"><p> Most zyBooks have thousands of integrated learning questions ("Participation Activities") and auto-generated auto-graded homework problems ("Challenge Activities"), obviating the need for a traditional textbook's end-of-section exercises. However, for this Discrete Math zyBook, instructors strongly requested a pool of additional exercises, from which they could choose a subset to be used for extra homework problems and/or to provide a few more examples to students. So we added such exercises to this zyBook. And rather than creating a separate solutions manual and requiring instructors to figure out a way to make those solutions available to students, we instead provide a convenient method for instructors to reveal such solutions to students near the actual exercise. </p><p>However, please note that those solutions are the equivalent of an instructor's solution manual. As such, we expect a similar usage protocol, namely that instructors will select only an appropriate subset of solutions to reveal, if any. In particular, to protect the integrity of the exercises and their solutions for all universities using them, instructors should not reveal a large number of solutions to students, which is akin to handing out photocopies of large portions of an instructor's solutions manual. Along those lines, we do not support revealing solutions in batch. For more information, see this <a href="https://zybooks.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035883294" target="_blank">instructor help article on exercise solutions</a>.  Also note that, like a traditional book, the student's subscription to the zyBook does not entitle them to solutions. An instructor may choose to reveal no solutions or some subset for their class. Students subscribing to a non-class zyBook do not get access to solutions but do get access to the 1000+ Participation Activities and Challenge Activities. </p><p>We ultimately hope that, with ongoing development, the Participation Activities and the Challenge Activities will continue to replace more such end-of-section exercises. Such activities provide a more modern, learner-centric approach to providing students with opportunities for formative assessment. We continue to invest in developing such activities, while striving to support instructors' wishes for traditional exercises as well. </p></div><div class="content-resource html-resource html-content-resource ember-view"><h3>About proofs</h3></div><div class="content-resource html-resource html-content-resource ember-view"><p>zyBooks does not have an automated proof checker. However, we do have a dynamic, automated way for students to learn how to write proofs. zyBooks has worked to automate as much as possible in the learning process.</p><p>Students still hand-write proofs to be graded by the professor or TAs. These proofs appear as part of end-of-section exercises. The solutions are available right below the exercise if and when the instructor decides to make them available to students.</p><p>But before students write full proofs, they learn how from the text and - more importantly - from the animations and auto-graded activities that are embedded directly into the text. In fact, there is more interactive material than static text.</p><p>The animations reveal each step of a proof one at a time with explanations about best practices and more detail. Seeing a full proof all at once in a static text is intimidating, so the animations in the zyBook are meant to relieve some of that pressure.</p><p>There are also auto-graded activities. A common activity gives students the steps to a proof and has them drag the steps into the correct order in the proof. Another activity presents a proof with some parts blank and has students select the correct next steps. In the two main chapters on proofs, there are more than 150 of these activities with many different types.</p><p>This interactive material is not meant as a replacement for students writing proofs, but to serve as a more dynamic and engaging way than in a static text for students to succeed at the difficult task of writing proofs. Students learn by doing.</p><p>In terms of the approach to teaching proofs, learning to speak and think like a mathematician does not come naturally. In particular, most books ignore the fact that students are not familiar with the language of proofs, so the first three sections on proofs focus on terminology, language, and best practices. Then the text moves into the various types of proofs.</p></div><div class="content-resource html-resource html-content-resource ember-view"><h3>Test bank</h3></div><div class="content-resource html-resource html-content-resource ember-view"><p>Adopters have access to a test bank with more than 450 multiple choice questions.
